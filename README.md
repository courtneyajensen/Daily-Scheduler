Description: This app is a simple way to organize your daily work activities and commitments. The app runs in the browser and uses HTML and CSS as well as jQuery.

User Story: As an employee with a busy schedule I want to add important events to a daily planner, so that I can manage my time effectively.

Usage: The planner displays work hours from 9AM - 5PM. At the top of the planner the current day of the week and date are displayed. Each block of time is color coded to indicate the time past (grey), present time (dark red), and future (dark green). Each time block allows you to input information and save it to local storage.
